The goal of this project is to analyze complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled from various geographies for 
SNP variants and determine genotypes. These variants will be compared across geographies to identify 
mutation patterns over time. Similarity will be measured using the Jaccard similarity coefficient as 
outlined in [Yin, 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7184998/)

(Alternative idea: Compare sequences from [patient with reinfection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/674796)
